# auto-frameworks

This repository contains different test automation frameworks I tried using different tools. 

Mainly this will keep my R&D work in one common place.



## Basic Git commands

* Add files to master
```
git add * (or file name)
git commit -m "Say what you adding"
git push origin master
git status
```

* Remove directory from git but NOT local
```
git rm -r --cached <myFolder>
git commit -m "Remove duplicated directory"
git push origin <your-git-branch> (typically 'master', but not always)
```
