# auto-frameworks

This repository contains different test automation frameworks I tried using different tools. 

Mainly this will keep my R&D work in one common place.


# Useful Git commands

git add * (or file name)

git commit -m "Say what you adding"

git push origin master

# Remove directory from git but NOT local

git rm -r --cached <myFolder>
	
git commit -m "Remove duplicated directory"

git push origin <your-git-branch> (typically 'master', but not always)
